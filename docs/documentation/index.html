        <h1>Checkpoint Documentation</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Checkpoint is a save game manager for local games. It helps you create backups (snapshots) 
          of your save files, switch between different saves, and protect your progress from accidents 
          or corruption.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What is Checkpoint?</h2>
        <p>
          If you play games outside of Steam, GOG, or other platforms that automatically sync saves, 
          you probably know the pain of losing progress. Maybe a save got corrupted, or you want to 
          try a different path in the game without losing your main progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Checkpoint solves this by letting you create timestamped backups of your save files. 
          You can have multiple saves for the same game, switch between them instantly, and never 
          worry about losing hours of progress again.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Snapshots</strong> - Create timestamped backups with one click</li>
          <li><strong>Instant Restore</strong> - Switch between saves in seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Smart Protection</strong> - Auto-backs up current save before restoring</li>
          <li><strong>Game Covers</strong> - Upload custom images to identify games visually</li>
          <li><strong>Process Detection</strong> - Won't restore while game is running</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-Platform</strong> - Windows, Linux, and macOS support</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="installation">
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        
        <h3>Windows</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Download <code>checkpoint.exe</code> from the releases page</li>
          <li>Place it anywhere (Documents, Desktop, etc.)</li>
          <li>Double-click to run - no installation needed</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Checkpoint is a portable executable. It doesn't require installation 
          and doesn't write to the registry.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <p><strong>Debian/Ubuntu:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>sudo dpkg -i checkpoint_0.1.0_amd64.deb</code></pre>
        
        <p><strong>Fedora:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>sudo rpm -i checkpoint-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm</code></pre>
        
        <p><strong>Arch (AUR):</strong></p>
        <pre><code>yay -S checkpoint</code></pre>
        
        <p>
          You can also run the AppImage directly without installing: 
          <code>chmod +x Checkpoint-0.1.0.AppImage && ./Checkpoint-0.1.0.AppImage</code>
        </p>
        
        <h3>macOS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Download the <code>Checkpoint_0.1.0.dmg</code></li>
          <li>Open the DMG and drag Checkpoint to your Applications folder</li>
          <li>On first launch, you may need to right-click and select "Open" due to Gatekeeper</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section id="first-game">
        <h2>Your First Game</h2>
        
        <p>
          Let's add your first game to Checkpoint. For this example, we'll use a hypothetical 
          game called "RPG Adventure" that stores saves in <code>Documents/MyGames/RPGAventure</code>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Click "Add Game"</h3>
        <p>
          In the sidebar, click the green "Add Game" button. This opens a modal where you'll 
          enter the game details.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Fill in the Details</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Game Name</strong> - "RPG Adventure" (whatever you want to call it)</li>
          <li><strong>Save Location</strong> - The folder where save files are stored. Use the 
          "Browse" button to navigate to it, or type the path directly.</li>
          <li><strong>Executable Name (optional)</strong> - "RPGAdventure.exe" - This lets Checkpoint 
          check if the game is running before restoring saves.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Add a Cover (Optional)</h3>
        <p>
          Click on the cover upload area to add an image. This helps identify the game visually. 
          Works best with vertical images (3:4 ratio) like game box art. Max size 2MB, JPG or PNG.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Save</h3>
        <p>
          Click "Add Game" and you're done! The game now appears on your dashboard with a card 
          showing the cover (or a placeholder), name, save location, and creation date.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="snapshots">
        <h2>Working with Snapshots</h2>
        
        <p>
          Snapshots are the heart of Checkpoint. They're complete copies of your save folder 
          at a specific point in time, stored safely in your backup location.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Creating a Snapshot</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Click on a game card to open its detail page</li>
          <li>Click the "Create Snapshot" button</li>
          <li>Give it a name (optional) - something descriptive like "Before Boss Fight" or "Good Ending Route"</li>
          <li>Click "Create"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The snapshot is created with a timestamp. For large games (several GB), this might 
          take a minute. A loading indicator shows progress.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Snapshot Details</h3>
        <p>Each snapshot shows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name (or timestamp if unnamed)</li>
          <li>Date and time created</li>
          <li>Size of the backup</li>
          <li>Number of files</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Renaming Snapshots</h3>
        <p>
          Click the pencil icon on any snapshot to rename it. This is useful when you initially 
          create a quick backup but later want to give it a more descriptive name.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Deleting Snapshots</h3>
        <p>
          Click the trash icon to delete a snapshot. You'll get a confirmation dialog because 
          this cannot be undone. Deleted snapshots free up disk space immediately.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="restore">
        <h2>Restoring Saves</h2>
        
        <p>
          Restoring replaces your current save files with the files from a snapshot. This is 
          useful for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Going back to an earlier point in the game</li>
          <li>Trying different choices/paths without starting over</li>
          <li>Recovering from corrupted saves</li>
          <li>Sharing saves between different playthroughs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How to Restore</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the game's detail page</li>
          <li>Find the snapshot you want to restore</li>
          <li>Click the restore button (circular arrow icon)</li>
          <li>Confirm the restore operation</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Safety Features</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Auto-Backup:</strong> Before restoring, Checkpoint automatically creates a 
          snapshot of your current save. This means if you change your mind, you can restore 
          back to where you were. Look for snapshots named "Auto-backup before restore" in 
          your snapshot list.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Process Detection:</strong> If you provided an executable name when adding 
          the game, Checkpoint will check if it's running before allowing a restore. This 
          prevents conflicts and corrupted saves. Close the game first, then restore.
        </p>
        
        <div class="warning">
          <strong>Warning:</strong> Restoring will overwrite your current save files. While 
          Checkpoint auto-backs up first, make sure you understand which snapshot you're 
          restoring to. The confirmation dialog shows the snapshot name and date to help 
          prevent mistakes.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="covers">
        <h2>Game Covers</h2>
        
        <p>
          Game covers make your dashboard look great and help you quickly identify games. 
          They're optional but recommended.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> Use vertical images (portrait orientation), ideally 3:4 ratio</li>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> Keep under 2MB for fast loading</li>
          <li><strong>Format:</strong> JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency</li>
          <li><strong>Source:</strong> Box art from SteamGridDB, IGDB, or official game sites work great</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Adding Covers to Existing Games</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, covers can only be added when creating a game. If you want to add a cover 
          to an existing game, you'll need to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Note down the save location from the game's detail page</li>
          <li>Delete the game from Checkpoint (this doesn't delete your actual saves)</li>
          <li>Add the game again with the same details plus the cover image</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Future versions will support adding covers to existing games directly.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="manage">
        <h2>Managing Games</h2>
        
        <h3>Deleting a Game</h3>
        <p>
          To remove a game from Checkpoint:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the game's detail page</li>
          <li>Click the "Delete Game" button (top right)</li>
          <li>Confirm the deletion</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> Deleting a game from Checkpoint removes the game entry 
          and all its snapshots from your backup location. It does NOT delete your actual 
          game saves from their original location. Your current progress remains untouched.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Where Are Backups Stored?</h3>
        <p>
          By default, snapshots are stored in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Windows:</strong> <code>C:\Users\YourUsername\checkpoint\</code></li>
          <li><strong>Linux/macOS:</strong> <code>~/checkpoint/</code> (your home folder)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Inside that folder, each game gets its own folder named with the game's ID, 
          and snapshots are stored within those folders.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can change this location in Settings if you want backups on a different drive 
          (useful if you have limited space on your main drive).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="settings">
        <h2>Settings</h2>
        
        <p>
          Access settings by clicking "Settings" in the sidebar. Here you can customize 
          Checkpoint to your preferences.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>
          Toggle between Light and Dark themes. Your preference is saved and applies 
          immediately across the app.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Language</h3>
        <p>
          Checkpoint supports multiple languages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>English</li>
          <li>Portuguese</li>
          <li>Spanish</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Select your preferred language from the dropdown. The change applies immediately.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="backup-location">
        <h2>Backup Location</h2>
        
        <p>
          By default, Checkpoint stores all snapshots in <code>~/checkpoint/</code> on your 
          home drive. You can change this to any folder you have write access to.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why Change It?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Different Drive:</strong> Store backups on an external drive or secondary HDD/SSD</li>
          <li><strong>Cloud Sync:</strong> Point to a Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive folder for automatic cloud backup</li>
          <li><strong>Space Management:</strong> If your main drive is filling up, move backups elsewhere</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Changing the Location</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open Settings</li>
          <li>Under "Backup Location", click "Browse" or type a new path</li>
          <li>Click "Save Settings"</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="warning">
          <strong>Warning:</strong> Changing the backup location does NOT move existing snapshots. 
          You'll need to manually move the files from the old location to the new one if you want 
          to keep them. New snapshots will go to the new location.
        </div>
        
        <h3>Recommended Setup</h3>
        <p>
          For the best protection, consider pointing your backup location to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An external drive that you only connect for backups</li>
          <li>A cloud-synced folder (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)</li>
          <li>A NAS or network drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This way, even if your main drive fails, your saves are safe elsewhere.
        </p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Does Checkpoint work with Steam/GOG/Epic games?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, but it's designed primarily for games that DON'T have cloud save sync. 
            Steam, GOG, and Epic already backup your saves to the cloud. Checkpoint is 
            most useful for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pirated games (not that we endorse that, but it works)</li>
            <li>GOG games with cloud sync disabled</li>
            <li>Old games from before cloud saves were common</li>
            <li>Emulated games (retro console emulators)</li>
            <li>Games from itch.io or other indie platforms</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Will Checkpoint slow down my games?</h3>
          <p>
            No. Checkpoint only accesses your save files when you explicitly create a 
            snapshot or restore. It doesn't run in the background monitoring files or 
            using CPU. The only time it's active is when the window is open and you're 
            using it.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I use Checkpoint for games with anti-cheat?</h3>
          <p>
            Generally yes, but with caution. Checkpoint only copies files in your save 
            directory. It doesn't modify game files, inject code, or do anything that 
            would trigger anti-cheat. However, some aggressive anti-cheat systems might 
            flag any file operations near game files. If you're unsure, check with the 
            game's community first.

          <h3>How much disk space do I need?</h3>
          <p>
            Each snapshot is a complete copy of your save folder. If your saves are 
            500MB and you create 10 snapshots, that's ~5GB. Plan accordingly. You can 
            always delete old snapshots to free space.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I move snapshots between computers?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes! The snapshot folders are self-contained. You can copy them from one 
            computer's checkpoint folder to another. Just make sure the game is installed 
            at the same save location path on both machines.

          <h3>Is my data safe?</h3>
          <p>
            Checkpoint never sends your save files anywhere. Everything stays local on 
            your machine (or wherever you set your backup location). The app doesn't 
            connect to the internet except to check for updates (which you can disable).

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        
        <h3>"Failed to create snapshot" Error</h3>
        <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Checkpoint can't read the save files or write to the backup location.</p>
        <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure the game isn't running (some games lock save files while running)</li>
          <li>Check that you have read permissions on the save folder</li>
          <li>Verify you have write permissions and disk space at the backup location</li>
          <li>Try running Checkpoint as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>"Game is currently running" Warning</h3>
        <p>
          You provided an executable name when adding the game, and Checkpoint detected 
          it's running. Close the game completely (check Task Manager/System Monitor) 
          before restoring. Some games have launcher processes that stay open - make 
          sure those are closed too.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Snapshots Taking Forever</h3>
        <p>
          Large save files (several GB) take time to copy. This is normal for games 
          with large worlds or many mods. The loading overlay shows it's working. 
          Don't close Checkpoint during this time.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Restored Save Not Showing In-Game</h3>
        <p>
          Make sure you:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Restored while the game was completely closed</li>
          <li>Waited for the restore to complete (saw success message)</li>
          <li>Didn't have the game running in the background</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Some games cache save data in memory. If the game was running, it might not 
          see the restored files until restarted.

        <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
        
        <h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
        <p>
          Develop a naming system for snapshots that makes sense to you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chapter-based:</strong> "Ch3 Complete"</li>
          <li><strong>Location-based:</strong> "Before Final Dungeon"</li>
          <li><strong>Choice-based:</strong> "Joined Faction A"</li>
          <li><strong>Date-based:</strong> "2024-02-09 Evening"</li>
          <li><strong>Build-based:</strong> "Melee Build Lvl 50"</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The "Before" Rule</h3>
        <p>
          Always create a snapshot BEFORE:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Major boss fights</li>
          <li>Story choices that can't be undone</li>
          <li>Trying out mods</li>
          <li>Experimenting with game files</li>
          <li>Starting a new playthrough (to preserve old saves)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Clean Up Regularly</h3>
        <p>
          Snapshots take up space. Every few months, review your snapshots and delete:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Old auto-backups ("Auto-backup before restore")</li>
          <li>Snapshots from completed playthroughs you won't return to</li>
          <li>Duplicate snapshots (same point in game)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Multiple Save Strategies</h3>
        <p>
          Use Checkpoint alongside in-game save slots for maximum protection:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In-game saves for quick load/save during play</li>
          <li>Checkpoint snapshots for major milestones and backups</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Share Saves With Friends</h3>
        <p>
          Want to share a cool save state? The snapshot folder is self-contained. 
          Zip it up and send it to a friend. They can place it in their Checkpoint 
          folder and restore it (make sure they have the same game version).
        </p>
        
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Set up a recurring reminder to create a snapshot 
          weekly. It's a 5-second habit that could save you hours of lost progress.
